Description: NutrienTrackeR is a collection of tools to estimate the nutrient intake of an individual or a group of individuals (e.g. obese or diabetic subjects). It uses food composition data from several reference databases, including: USDA (US), CIQUAL (France), and BEDCA (Spain). NutrienTrackeR calculates the intake levels for both macronutrient and micronutrients, and compares them with the recommended dietary allowances (RDA). It includes a number of visualization tools, such as time series plots of nutrient intake, and pie-charts showing the main foods contributing to the intake level of a given nutrient.
