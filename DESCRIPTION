Description: Provides a tool set for food information and dietary assessment. It 
    uses food composition data from several reference databases, including: 'USDA' (United States), 
    'CIQUAL' (France), 'BEDCA' (Spain) and 'CNF' (Canada). 'NutrienTrackeR' calculates the intake 
    levels for both macronutrient and micronutrients, and compares them with the recommended 
    dietary allowances (RDA). It includes a number of visualization tools, such as time series 
    plots of nutrient intake, and pie-charts showing the main foods contributing to the intake 
    level of a given nutrient. A shiny app exposing the main functionalities of the package is also 
    provided.
