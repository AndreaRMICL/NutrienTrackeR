Description: Provides a tool set for food information and dietary assessment. It uses food composition data from several reference databases, including: 'USDA' (United States), 'CIQUAL' (France), and 'BEDCA' (Spain). 'NutrienTrackeR' calculates the intake levels for both macronutrient and micronutrients, and compares them with the recommended dietary allowances (RDA). It includes a number of visualization tools, such as time series plots of nutrient intake, and pie-charts showing the main foods contributing to the intake level of a given nutrient.
